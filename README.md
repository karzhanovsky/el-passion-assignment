Front-end Developer Assignment

Requested layout has been created using HTML and CSS only.

External resources:
https://fonts.google.com - Roboto and Montserrat fonts
http://fontawesome.io/ - Fav icon (star)

Text content is purely a dummy text, in an app will come from data sources.
Although the filters have 2 states: hover (pseudo class) and active (class), the app's layout doesn't switch the tabs. Implementing such a functionality is possible using HTML+CSS only but isn't recommended.

Font used in the sidebar's issues count is Roboto - Proxima Nova used in the PSD file requires a license. Purchase on demand.

Assets used in the project belong to EL Passion Next Sp. z o.o.
